zmath it's a small quick made lib for Vectors, Matrix and Quaternions maths made over standard float point types and in language D 2.
I made it on the way of self-learning D, but I think that could be usefull, so I open the source code.

The main objetive it's be usefull for doing basic things with 2d / 3d job and using ir with OpenGL (Matrix it's column-major ordered in a single array)

For any serius usage, I recomend the excelent and well maintained gfm library : https://github.com/d-gamedev-team/gfm
