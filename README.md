ZMath it's a quick&dirty lib for Vectors, Matrix and Quaternions maths write on DLang, and using standard float point types.

I made it on the way of self-learning D, but I think that could be useful, so I open the source code.

The main objective it's be useful for doing basic things with 2d / 3d and allow using it with OpenGL.

For any serius usage, I recommend the excellent and battle tested gfm library : https://github.com/d-gamedev-team/gfm

## TODO:

- More useful math functions, like lerp and quaternion lerping
- Use SIMD
