ZMath it's a quick&dirty lib for Vectors, Matrix and Quaternions maths wirte on DLang, and using standard float point types.

I made it on the way of self-learning D, but I think that could be usefull, so I open the source code.

The main objetive it's be usefull for doing basic things with 2d / 3d and allow using it with OpenGL.

For any serius usage, I recomend the excelent and well maintained gfm library : https://github.com/d-gamedev-team/gfm

## TODO:

- More usefull math funtions
- Basic 2d collision :
  - Circle collision
  - Aligned boxes
  - Convex shapes
- Use SIMD
